# BPMN2 Editor in Eclipse

More information in wiki at https://github.com/imeikas/BPMN2-Editor-for-Eclipse/wiki

## Installation instructions

Please note that the editor is in active development and the latest continuous version might not be 100% stable!

### Requirements

 * Eclipse 3.6 or newer
 * Graphiti framework. Update site: http://download.eclipse.org/graphiti/updates/0.8.0/
 * EMF. Included in the main eclipse update sites

There are two ways for getting the editor:
** Update site ***

Use http://codehoop.com/bpmn2 update site to get the latest automated build of the editor.

** Source from Git **
Update site already includes the latest bpmn2 EMF model but to run from source, you need to check out additional EMF BPMN2 meta-model dependency from git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/bpmn2

Use git://github.com/imeikas/BPMN2-Editor-for-Eclipse.git for loading the source
